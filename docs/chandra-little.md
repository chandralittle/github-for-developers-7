**Chandra Little**

Hi, I'm Chandra!

* I'm originally from Texas, lived in New England a long while, and considering a move to somewhere new.
* I love lots of foods and hate picking favorites, but steamed buns have been on my mind today.
* Knitting and Snowshoeing have helped me survive the winters!
* The color green always cheers me up.
